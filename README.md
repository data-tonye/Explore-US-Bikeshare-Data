# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Project 2 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND)

# Project Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.

# Project Specifications
- Code Quality
- Responses to Analysis Questions

**Code Quality**

*Functionality of code*
- All code cells can be run without error.

*Choice of data types and structures*
- Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.

*Use of loops and conditional statements*
- Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.

*Use of packages*
- Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks such as reading and writing files and creating visualizations.

*Use of functions*
- Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.

*Use of good coding practices*
- Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code
